<h1>String Analysis</h1>
<br>
<br>

You are given a string that represents an email address: 

`"My e-mail: eMail_Address321@anymail.com"`.
Your task is to analyze the composition of the characters in the string and determine the percentage of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and other characters such as symbols (#$., etc).
<br>
<br>

To accomplish this, you need to break down the string and calculate the percentage for each category. 
<br>
<br>
The results are as follows:
<br>
<br>
Uppercase letters: 7.5%
<br>
Lowercase letters: 65%
<br>
Digits: 7.5%
<br>
Other characters (symbols): 20%
<br>

<h1>Contiguous Array</h1>
<br>
Given a binary array 'nums', you are required to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.
<br>
<br>
Explanation:
<br>
<br>
A binary array is an array that contains only 0s and 1s.<br>
A subarray is any subset of the indices of the original array.<br>
<br>
A contiguous subarray is a subarray in which all the elements are consecutive, i.e., any element between the first and last element of the subarray is also part of it.
<br>
<br>
Examples:
<br>
<br>

Input: `nums = [0, 1]`
<br>
Output: `2`
<br>
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is [0, 1] with a length of 2.
<br>
<br>

The problem requires finding the maximum length of a contiguous subarray in the binary array 'nums' that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.
